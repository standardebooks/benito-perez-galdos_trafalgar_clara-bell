<p>It was on one of the early days of October in
that fatal year, 1805, that my worthy master called
me into his room and looked at me with the severity
that was habitual to him—a severity that
was only on the surface for his nature was gentleness
itself—he said:</p>
<p>“Gabriel, are you a brave man?”</p>
<p>I did not know what to answer, for, to tell the
truth, in my fourteen years of life no opportunity
had ever presented itself for me to astonish the
world with any deed of valor; still, it filled me
with pride to hear myself called a man, and thinking
it ill-judged to deny myself the credit of courage
before any one who held it in such high
estimation, I answered, with boyish boldness:</p>
<p>“Yes, sir, I am a brave man.”</p>
<p>At this the noble gentleman, who had shed his
blood in a hundred glorious fights and who nevertheless
did not disdain to treat a faithful servant
with frank confidence, smiled at me kindly, signed
to me to take a seat, and seemed on the point of
informing me of some business of importance,

when his wife, my mistress, Doña Francisca entered
the study, and, to give further interest to the
discussion, began to declaim with vehemence.</p>
<p>“You are not to go,” she said, “I declare you
shall not join the fleet. What next will you be
wanting to do?—at your age and when you have
long retired as superannuated! No, no, Alonso
my dear. You are past sixty and your dancing
days are over.”</p>
<p>I can see her now, that respectable and indignant
dame—with her deep-bordered cap, her
muslin dress, her white curls, and a hairy mole on
one side of her chin. I describe these miscellaneous
details, for they are inseparable from my
recollection of her. She was pretty even in old age,
like Murillo’s Santa Anna, and her sober beauty
would have justified the comparison if only the
lady had been as silent as a picture. Don Alonso
somewhat cowed, as he always was, by her flow of
words, answered quietly:</p>
<p>“I must go, Paquita. From the letter I have
just now received from my worthy friend Churruca,
I learn that the united squadrons are either to sail
from Cadiz and engage the English or to wait for
them in the bay in case they are so bold as to enter.
In either case it will be no child’s play.”</p>
<p>“That is well, and I am glad to hear it,”

replied Doña Francisca. “There are Gravina, Valdés,
Cisneros, Churruca, Alcalá Galiano, and
Alava; let them pound away at the English dogs.
But you are a piece of useless lumber who can do
no good if you go. Why you cannot move that
left arm which they dislocated for you at Cape
St. Vincent.”</p>
<p>My master lifted his arm, with a stiff attempt
at military precision, to show that he could use it.
But his wife, not convinced by so feeble an argument,
went on with shrill asseveration.</p>
<p>“No, you shall not go, what can they want of
a piece of antiquity like you. If you were still
forty as you were when you went to Tierra del
Fuego and brought me back those green Indian
necklaces.—Then indeed! But now!—I know,
that ridiculous fellow Marcial fired your brain this
morning with talking to you about battles. It
seems to me that Señor Marcial and I will come
to quarrelling.—Let him go to the ships if he
likes and pay them out for the foot he lost! Oh!
Saint Joseph the blessed! If I had known when I
was a girl what you seamen were! Endless
worry; never a day’s peace! A woman marries to
live with her husband and one fine day a dispatch
comes from Madrid and he is sent off at two
minutes notice to the Lord knows where—Patagonia

or Japan or the infernal regions. For ten or
twelve months she sees nothing of him and at last,
if the savages have not eaten him meanwhile, he
comes back again the picture of misery—so ill
and yellow that she does not know what to do to
restore him to his right color. But old birds are
not to be caught in a trap, and then suddenly another
dispatch comes from Madrid, with orders to
go to Toulon or Brest or Naples—go here and go
there—wherever it is necessary to meet the whims
of that rascally First Consul...! If you would
all do as I say, you would soon payout these gentlemen
who keep the world in a turmoil!”</p>
<p>My master sat smiling and gazing at a cheap
print, badly colored by some cheap artist, which
was nailed against the wall, and which represented
the Emperor Napoleon mounted on a green
charger, in the celebrated “redingote” which was
smeared with vermilion. It was no doubt the sight
of this work of art, which I had seen daily for four
years, which had modified my ideas with respect
to the smuggler’s costume of the great man of the
day, and had fixed his image in my mind as
dressed something like a cardinal and riding a
green horse.</p>
<p>“This is not living!” Doña Francisca went on,
throwing up her arms: “God forgive me, but I

hate the sea, though they say it is one of His most
glorious works. What is the use of the Holy Inquisition,
will you tell me, if it is not to burn
those diabolical ships of war to ashes? What is
the good of this incessant firing of cannon,—balls
upon balls, all directed against four boards, as you
may say, which are soon smashed to leave hundreds
of hapless wretches to drown in the sea? Is
not that provoking God?—And yet you men are
half-wild as soon as you hear a cannon fired!
Merciful Heaven! my flesh creeps at the sound,
and if every one was of my way of thinking, we
should have no more sea-fights, and the cannon
would be cast into bells. Look here, Alonso,” she
said, standing still in front of her husband, “it
seems to me that they have done you damage
enough already; what more do you want? You
and a parcel of madmen like yourself,—had you
not enough to satisfy you on the 14th?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1" id="noteref-1" epub:type="noteref">1</a></p>
<p>Don Alonso clenched his fists at this bitter
reminiscence, and it was only out of consideration
for his wife, to whom he paid the utmost respect,
that he suppressed a good round oath.</p>
<p>“I lay all the blame of your absurd determination
to join the fleet to that rascally Marcial,”

the lady went on, warming with her own eloquence;
“that maniac for the sea who ought to
have been drowned a hundred times and over, but
that he escaped a hundred times to be the torment
of my life. If he wants to join, with his wooden
leg, his broken arm, his one eye, and his fifty
wounds—let him go, by all means, and God grant
he may never come back here again—but you
shall not go, Alonso, for you are past service and
have done enough for the King who has paid you
badly enough in all conscience. If I were you, I
would throw those captain’s epaulettes you have
worn these ten years in the face of the Generalissimo
of the land and sea forces. My word! they
ought have made you admiral, at least; you
earned that when you went on that expedition to
Africa and brought me back those blue beads
which I gave with the Indian necklace to
decorate the votive urn to the Virgin ‘del
Cármen.’”</p>
<p>“Admiral or not, it is my duty to join the
fleet, Paquita,” said my master. “I cannot be
absent from this struggle. I feel that I must pay
off some of my arrears to the English.”</p>
<p>“Do you talk of paying off arrears!” exclaimed
my mistress; “you—old, feeble, and half-crippled....”</p>
<p>
“Gabriel will go with me,” said Don Alonso,
with a look at me which filled me with valor.</p>
<p>I bowed to signify that I agreed to this heroic
scheme, but I took care not to be seen by my
mistress, who would have let me feel the full
weight of her hand if she had suspected my bellicose
inclinations. Indeed, seeing that her husband
was fully determined, she was more furious
than ever, declaring that if she had to live her
life again nothing should induce her to marry a
sailor. She cursed the Emperor, abused our revered
King, the Prince of Peace, and all those who
had signed the Treaty of Subsidies, ending by
threatening the brave old man with punishment
from Heaven for his insane rashness.</p>
<p>During this dialogue, which I have reported
with approximate exactness as I have to depend
on my memory, a loud barking cough in the adjoining
room revealed the fact that Marcial, the
old sailor, could overhear with perfect ease, my
mistress’s vehement harangue, in which she had so
frequently mentioned him in by no means flattering
terms. Being now desirous of taking part in
the conversation, as his intimacy in the house fully
justified his doing, he opened the door and came
into Don Alfonso’s room. Before going any
farther I must give some account of my master’s

former history, and of his worthy wife, that the
reader may have a better understanding of what
follows.</p>
